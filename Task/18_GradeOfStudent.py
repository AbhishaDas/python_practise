If Arun has a score of

Arunâ€™s overall grade = (81x70)/100 + (68x20)/100 + (92x10)/100 = 79.5
 Write a program to find the grade of a student during his academic year. 
Program should accept the scores for written test, lab exams and assignments
Output the grade of a student (using weighted average)
Eg:
Enter the marks scored by the students
Written test = 55
Lab exams = 73
Assignments = 87
Grade of the student is 61.8 """
